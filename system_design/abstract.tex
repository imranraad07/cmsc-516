Social media posts have become an enormous source of population health. Users often share their experiences about medication intake and their effects. A fundamental step toward incorporating social media data in pharmacoepidemiologic research is to automatic medication names detection in these posts. However, detecting drug name mentioning posts are challenging as they are often informal and noisy. Medication names are often misspelled and abbreviated. The purpose of this study is to detect medication name spans in tweets.
