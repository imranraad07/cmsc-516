    annote = {While social media sites (e.g., Twitter) have become surveillance of drug safety at the population level, studies that focus on specific sets of individuals would require the ability to distinguish indications of personal medication intake. Klein et al. divided their research into three parts: data collection, annotation, and classification. The experiment queried 73800 Twitter user timelines for 55 medication names and annotated 10260 tweets. The annotation had been limited over three classes: intake tweets indicate that 1. the medication was taken, 2. the author of the tweet personally took the medication, and 3. the medication was taken at a specific time. The classification is performed using several supervised algorithms. Klein et al. note that the goal for the experiments was to (a) verify that automatic classifiers could be trained using this data, and (b) generate baseline performance estimates.}

    annote = {Twitter has gradually become an area of interest for pharmacovigilance research. While the study on drug abuse, adverse reactions to drug usage, and analyzing the expression of sentiments related to drugs have been conducted on a large scale, Mahata et al. performed the study on a specific set of individuals similar to Klein at al~\cite{klein-etal-2017-detecting}. To conduct studies at an individual level, identifying posts mentioning intake of medicine by the user is necessary. Toward this objective, Mahata et al. develop a classifier for identifying mentions of personal intake of medicine in tweets using a Stacked Ensemble of Shallow Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The authors note that building an accurate text classification systems is the key in this process. Mahata et al. classified tweets in three categories: personal medication intake, possible medication intake, and non-intake. The experiment concluded over 9663 tweets with 5-fold cross-validation and achieved a 0.693 micro-averaged F-score.}

  annote = {Prescribed medication abuse is a growing medication-related problem. Social media posting can be a significant element to detect patterns and intents of abuse. The authors of this paper investigate this issue from tweets. NLP and ML can be applied to distinguish posts indicating prescription medication abuse. The authors collected Twitter posts(6400 tweets) associated with three commonly used medication(Adderall, Oxycodone, and Quetiapine) and one controlled medication(Metformin). They manually annotate them to determine whether posts on Twitter contain signals of prescription medication abuse. Then, the authors developed a supervised classification technique to determine whether tweets indicate medication abuse or not. The analysis shows that there is a clear signal of medication abuse can be identified from tweets, and the percentage is significantly higher for three case medication than for the control medication. The overall accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 82\%(positive class F score: 0.46). The authors identified three key factors to improve classification performances: identification of personal versus impersonal tweets, normalization of tweets, and the utilization of more training data.}

  annote = {Unlike Sarket et al.\cite{sarker2016social}, Wu et al. dedicated their research to Twitter's opinion about drug reactions. While FDA monitors adverse drug events reported by the healthcare providers and consumers, social networks, such as Twitter, can provide complementary information about adverse drug events(ADEs). The authors note some challenges to develop a model to detect ADEs. Firstly, a careful and intensive preprocessing of tweets is required. Secondly, precise decision rules are needed to identify the actual reactions of drug users, i.e., the writer’s own or someone else’s experience. And finally, there are no go standard rules about adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for training and validation of methods. Wu et al. applied sentiment analysis to extract ADRs from tweets. We developed some decision rules for data preprocessing and combined NLP with ML for the classification of tweets into two categories- tweets that report side effects and all other tweets. In this experiment, Wu et al. analyzed 3521 preprocessed tweets and found that potentially 345 tweets had signals of ADRs with an F-measure score of 0.794(using SVM).}

  annote = {Social media (i.e., Twitter) are a recognizable source of patient-generated data, providing unique insights into mass population health. A fundamental step toward incorporating social media in pharmacoepidemiologic research is to detect medication mentions in the post automatically. Often medication names suffer from misspellings or ambiguity with common words. In this paper, Weissenbacher et al. proposed a method to recognize medication names in social media focusing on Twitter data. The proposed method, \textit{Kusuri}, is comprised of 2 modules: first, four different classifiers (lexicon-based, spelling variant based, pattern-based, and a weakly trained neural network) parallelly to detect potential tweets; and second, an ensemble of deep neural networks to make the final decision. On a balanced dataset(15005 tweets) and an imbalanced dataset(98959 tweets), respectively, \textit{Kusuri} achieves an $F_1$ score of 93.7\% and 78.8\%. The authors note that \textit{Kusuri} is the first system to achieve this score on such an imbalanced dataset.}

  annote = {Twitter is an effective medium to get up-to-date information on current trends. A recent example is researching COVID-19. Sarker et al. focused on analyzing COVID-19 symptoms from self-reported tweets. For this task, Sarker et al. collected tweets using COVID-19-related keywords and performed several layers of semi-automatic filtering to curate self-reports of positive-tested users. For this experiment, Sarker et al. identified 203 positive-tested users who reported 932 symptoms using 598 unique expressions. From the tweets, the authors found that fever/pyrexia is the most commonly reported syndrome, followed by cough, body ache & pain, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, chills, anosmia, ageusia, throat pain, and chest pain. The experiment noticed that the median ages of the patients studied in clinical studies tended to be much higher than the median age of Twitter users. Sarker et al. concluded that The spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms would possibly complement the symptoms identified in clinical settings.}
