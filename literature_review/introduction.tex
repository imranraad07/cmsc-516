\section{Introduction}

Social media posts are often useful to detect real-time adverse drug reactions (ADR) compared to other available resources such as clinical reports, health records. They can be a valuable tool for pharmaceutical companies to obtain feedback about medication~\cite{plachouras2016quantifying, huynh2016adverse}. Data can easily be collected in real-time. Plachouras et al.~\cite{plachouras2016quantifying} reported that from July 9 to September 4, 2014 (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:daily-tweets-adr}), on average 179K tweets were mentioning drug names, and 721 tweets were containing ADRs. They proposed an ecosystem on clinical reports and social media posts can be useful to pharmaceutical companies - shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ecosystem-pharmaceutical}.

The problem of detecting medication names and ADRs mentioning social media are often interrelated. Weissenbacher et al.~\cite{weissenbacher2018overview} noted that these researches have been conducted extensively in recent years. Denecke et al.~\cite{DENECKE20091870} performed a content analysis of medical social media data, in particular question \& answer portals, weblogs, reviews, and wikis. De Rosa et al.~\cite{de114pharmacovigilance} researched cross-relating social media content with trusted sources such as PubMed. The researchers have essentially framed the task of medication name extraction and ADR detection as a binary classification problem. Machine learning techniques are widely used in this task. Deep learning techniques are becoming popular of late. In this review, we will give short overview of various techniques used by researchers.

This review is divided into a couple of sections: preprocessing, model, annotation, evaluation.
