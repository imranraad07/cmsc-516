Social media posts have become an enormous source of population health. Users often share their experiences about medication intake and their effects. A fundamental step toward incorporating social media data in pharmacoepidemiologic research is to automatic medication names detection in these posts. However, detecting drug name mentioning posts are challenging as they are often informal and noisy. Names are misspelled and abbreviated. In addition, they are often context-dependent. The purpose of this study is to explore some of the aspects of medication names extraction and adverse drug reaction(ADR) from social media. However, the focus is mostly on tweets.
